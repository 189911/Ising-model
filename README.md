# Ising-model
In this project, the Ising model was applied to obtain information on the thermal properties of a spins system. F2Py was used for large calculations. Even with small spin systems, this model has a high computational cost.
The ISI_Py.cp38-win_amd64.pyd is a python module created with F2py which executes the ISI_Py.f file. Once imported is used on "integrando.py" to obtain information.
The "ising_spin_anim.py" is just a file that makes a visual representation of the evolution of the spins system.
